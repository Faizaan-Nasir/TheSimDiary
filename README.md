## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice on Application Signing and Security 

**TheSimDiary** is currently distributed **without a code-signing certificate**, which means that operating systems like **Windows** and **macOS** may warn you when launching the application for the first time.

This is **not because the application is unsafe**, but simply because it hasn't yet been signed with a verified developer license. Signing certificates can be costly for independent developers, but obtaining one is **on the roadmap** as the project grows.

I assure you of the following:

- ‚úÖ **No personal or usage data is collected** ‚Äî your logs and data stay completely local on your system.  
- ‚úÖ The application is built in Python with open-source libraries, and the **source code is made available** for full transparency.  
- ‚úÖ You can inspect the code and verify its behavior yourself.  

**To run the application:**

- On **Windows**, click **"More Info" ‚Üí "Run Anyway"** when the Windows Defender warning appears.  
- On **macOS**, go to **System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy**, and allow the app manually after the first attempt.  

I appreciate your understanding and support as this project grows into something officially signed and verified.

## ü§ì Development Insights
- **Developed in Python** using **PyQt5** for a responsive and modern desktop UI  
- **CSS** used for custom styling of UI components
